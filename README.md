# **Checkers**

Rudimentary companion for working with CHESS and HEXRD. Mostly just a repo for Austin to share code

Big picture: Goal of HEXRD (I think) should be to assist in NF and FF reconstruction, which it does well. things like image processing and insturment-specific tools, which are CHESS-specific, make more sense to keep elsewhere. Also HEXRD is too convoluted to easily add to right now, so better to build what I need here and move over what works eventually.

- NF preprocessing- add to HEXRD?
- NF SL calibration
- FF SL calibration

## **Eventual General TODO's**
- functions to module, workflows to jupyter
- add python black github action
- add coveralls
- add version and OS build checks
